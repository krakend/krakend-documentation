The AMQP component allows to **send and receive messages to and from a queue** through the API Gateway.

The configuration of the queue is a straightforward process. To connect the endpoints to the messaging system you only need to include the `extra_config` key with the namespaces `backend/amqp/consumer` or `backend/amqp/producer`.

To create Async agents that consume messages asynchronously and without requiring a user request, see [Async Agents](/docs/v2.1/async/).

The parameters of this integration follow the AMQP specification. To understand
what are the implications of a certain parameter, see the **[AMQP Complete Reference Guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html)**.

**KrakenD creates both the exchange and the queue for you**.


## Configuration
The consumer retrieves messages from the queue when a KrakenD endpoint plugs to its AMQP backend. The recommendation is to connect consumers to `GET` endpoints.

A single endpoint can consume messages from N queues, or can consume N messages from the same queue by adding N backends with the proper queue name.

See [Async Agents](/docs/v2.1/async/) to consume messages without an endpoint.

The needed configuration to run a consumer is:

```json
{
    "backend": [{
        "host": ["amqp://guest:guest@myqueue.host.com:5672"],
        "disable_host_sanitize": true,
        "extra_config": {
            "backend/amqp/consumer": {
                "name": "queue-1",
                "exchange": "some-exchange",
                "durable": true,
                "delete": false,
                "no_wait": true,
                "no_local": false,
                "routing_key": ["#"],
                "prefetch_count": 10,
                "prefetch_size": 1024,
                "auto_ack": false
            }
        }
    }]
}
```
