The best experience consumers can have with KrakenD API is by letting the system fetch all the data from the different backends simultaneously. However, sometimes you need to **delay a backend call** until you have called a previous service. Although this is not ideal, the sequential proxy allows you to **chain backend requests**.

The Sequential Proxy enables chaining multiple backend requests where **the output of one call is used as input for the next**, whether just injecting previous values of the response in the URL or as the body for the next call. This capability is especially powerful for orchestrating **dependent operations** or implementing simple workflows across services. For complex workflows, see the [Workflows documentation](/docs/enterprise/endpoints/workflows/) ({{< badge >}}Enterprise{{< /badge >}})

Although achievable, we do not recommend adopting sequential patterns to perform token exchange or pre-authentication steps and use the dedicated components for such usages.

## Do you really need a sequential proxy?
{{< note title="Chained calls are considered an anti-pattern" type="warning" >}}
Using sequential calls is considered an anti-pattern because when you make a network service dependent on the other, you are **increasing the latency, decreasing the performance, and augmenting the error rate**.
{{< /note >}}

In non-sequential [aggregation](/docs/v2.10/endpoints/response-manipulation/#aggregation-and-merging), parallel requests execute simultaneously, whereas, in sequential aggregation, requests are executed one at a time, with each one waiting for the previous request to finish (or timeout) before moving on to the next. If a backend in a sequence fails, the process aborts and the next backend is never reached, so there are many more chances that your users will be left without data.

From an error rate perspective, the nature of sequential proxy performs more deficient: Suppose you have three backends with an error rate of 10% each, then the probability of success separately in each is 90%. However, when executing the three of them sequentially, the success rate drops to 73% (because `0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729`).

In an aggregation scenario, the probability of having at least one working call is the opposite of the likelihood of having all calls result in errors. So, the chance of all three calls resulting in errors is 0.1% (because `0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.001`).

The contrast between a 99.9% chance of some data availability and a 73% probability is quite substantial. Isn't it? That being said, from an architectural point of view, the sequential proxy should be your last resort.

In addition, you can add to a sequence **multiple unsafe methods** (methods different than `GET`). When you chain several write requests in multiple nodes, you execute a **distributed transaction** in a flowery disguise, as in a database. But a gateway is not a database, and you don't have any rollback mechanism if one of your write methods fails, so you can only *hope for the best*.

## Sequential proxy configuration
To enable the sequential proxy, you need to add in the endpoint definition the following configuration:

```json
{
    "endpoint": "/hotels/{id}",
    "extra_config": {
          "proxy": {
              "sequential": true
          }
      }
}
```

After doing this, the `backend` list is executed one by one, and the next call has the opportunity to access data returned by the previous call in the `url_pattern` and not anywhere else. **The body of the last request is not sent to the next**, but you can save it as a parameter **and inject it later** using the `sequential_propagated_params`.

When the sequential proxy is enabled, the `url_pattern` of every backend can use a new variable that references the **resp**onse of a previous API call. The sequential proxy variables have the following construction:

```js
{resp0_XXXX}
```

Where `0` is the index of the specific `backend` you want to access (`0` for the first backend, `1` for the second, and so on), and where `XXXX` is the attribute name you want to inject from the response of the previous call. You can also access **nested objects** of the response using the dot notation. For example, given a response `{"user": { "hash": "abcdef }}`, the variable`{resp0_user.hash}` will contain the value `abcdef`. **You cannot access nested objects inside arrays or collections**: fields must be objects (although you could manipulate these arrays using flatmap or JMESpath to convert them to objects).

You can reuse the `{resp0_XXXX}` variable in the `url_pattern` in any form you like, as part of the path or as a query string. For instance, the following examples would work:

```json
{
    "url_pattern": "/user/{resp0_user.hash}"
}
```

And also:

```json
{
    "url_pattern": "/user?hash={resp0_user.hash}"
}
```
{{< note title="All values are represented as string" type="warning" >}}
When using the `{resp0}` and similar variables, the value you get is always a string. This means that if, for instance, KrakenD takes data from an object that contains a `null` value (not an empty value), the variable will be a string containing `<nil>`. For instance, in the examples above, if the response contained `{"user": { "hash": null } }`, the final value of the `url_pattern` would be `/user/<nil>` and `/user?hash=<nil>` respectively.

### Example of sequential proxy passing values on the `url_pattern`
It's easier to understand with the example of the graph:

![Chained call](/images/documentation/krakend-sequential-call.png)

The user calls the gateway with an URL like `/hotel-destinations/{id}`, which needs to fetch the hotel information and all its associated destinations. Let's say the ID they request is `25`. The gateway calls a backend `/hotels/25` that returns data for the requested hotel, including a `destination_id` field that is a relationship identifier. The output for `GET /hotels/25` is like the following:

```json
{
    "hotel_id": 25,
    "name": "Hotel California",
    "destination_id": 1034
}
```

KrakenD waits for the backend response and injects the value of `destination_id` in the URL of the next backend call. In this case, the next call is `GET /destinations/1034`, and the response is:

```json
{
    "destination_id": 1034,
    "destinations": [
        "LAX",
        "SFO",
        "OAK"
    ]
}
```

Now KrakenD has both responses from the backends and can merge the data, returning the following aggregated object to the user:

```json
{
    "hotel_id": 25,
    "name": "Hotel California",
    "destination_id": 1034,
    "destinations": [
        "LAX",
        "SFO",
        "OAK"
    ]
}
```

The configuration needed for this example is:

```json
{
    "endpoint": "/hotel-destinations/{id}",
    "backend": [
        {
            "@comment": "This is the index position 0",
            "host": [
                "https://hotels.api"
            ],
            "url_pattern": "/hotels/{id}"
        },
        {
            "@comment": "This is the index position 1",
            "host": [
                "https://destinations.api"
            ],
            "@comment2": "resp0_ is the response of index position 0",
            "url_pattern": "/destinations/{resp0_destination_id}"
        }
    ],
    "extra_config": {
        "proxy": {
            "sequential": true
        }
    }
}
```

The key here is the variable `{resp0_destination_id}` that refers to `destination_id` for the backend with index `0` (first in the list).

### Sequential proxy and special encodings
The sequential proxy parses the response of the previous backend, trying to understand the structure of the returned response so you can access its fields by name. When your backend does not use a parseable encoding, such as `string` or `no-op`, you can still access the responses but differently.

When the `encoding` of your backend is `string` (meaning it does not decode the contents and everything comes in a single string), then you can access its contents using `resp0_content`.

On the other hand, when your backend is `no-op` you can access the full response using `resp0` (also as a string).


## Passing previous values outside the `url_pattern`
By setting the flag `"sequential": true`, the responses of the backends are available in the following `url_pattern`s. But there will be times when you don't want the value in the `url_pattern`. You can reuse the payload of previous responses elsewhere by propagating the values using the `sequential_propagated_params` attribute. These are the sequential flags you have on the `proxy` configuration:

{{< schema version="v2.10" data="endpoint_extra_config.json" property="proxy" filter="sequential,sequential_propagated_params" title="Fields of endpoint's proxy property">}}


### Example: Setting a previous response as the payload of the next
The following example calls a backend and injects its response as the body payload of the next one. To accomplish this behavior, you can see the `sequential_propagated_params`. It saves the parameter `resp0`, which we reuse as `Resp0` in the Lua code of the second backend.

As we are taking **the entire payload** of the first backend (not specific fields), we have set a `no-op` encoding in the first backend so as not to parse the response and pass it as is to the next.

The Lua code in the second backend modifies the request and sets its body to the full response of the first backend (`req:body(req:params(\"Resp0\")`).

You can copy the code of this endpoint and test locally (it requires you to have the [debug endpoint](/docs/v2.10/endpoints/debug-endpoint/) enabled).

```json
{
    "endpoint": "/sequential/propagate-body",
    "extra_config": {
      "proxy": {
          "sequential": true,
          "sequential_propagated_params": ["resp0"]
      }
    },
    "backend": [
      {
          "encoding": "no-op",
          "url_pattern": "/__debug/",
          "host": [ "http://localhost:8080" ]
      },
      {
          "encoding": "json",
          "url_pattern": "/param_forwarding/",
          "host": [ "http://127.0.0.1:8081" ],
          "extra_config": {
            "modifier/lua-backend": {
                "allow_open_libs": true,
                "pre": "local req = request.load(); req:body(req:params(\"Resp0\"))"
            }
          }
      }
    ]
}
```
