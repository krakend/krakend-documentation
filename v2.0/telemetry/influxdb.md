KrakenD can expose very detailed metrics to provide a **monitoring dashboard**. One of the richest monitoring solutions at the metrics level is the combination of [krakend-metrics](/docs/v2.0/telemetry/extended-metrics/) with the native **krakend-influx** exporter. The two components let you send detailed metrics to InfluxDB and draw them later on our preconfigured [Grafana dashboard](/docs/v2.0/telemetry/grafana/) can feed from here and provide you a useful.

## InfluxDB configuration
Notice that there are **two different implementations** of InfluxDB in KrakenD that are described in this document:

- Native InfluxDB exporter (**recommended**)
- OpenCensus InfluxDB exporter

{{< note title="Which InfluxDB implementation should I choose?" >}}
The **native implementation** exports data from a collector that is tailor-made and maintained by KrakenD, and is **richer in content**. On the other hand, the OpenCensus exporter for InfluxDB is more generalistic and abstract, and is configured similary to other systems, but implements a collector with less data. For our Grafana dahsboard, choose the native one.
{{< /note >}}

### Native InfluxDB configuration

Pushing data to InfluxDB using the native middleware requires adding two different configuration pieces:

- Enabling the extended metrics (collecting the information)
- Enabling InfluxDB (pushing the data)

You can accomplish it with the following snippet.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
    "version": 3,
    "extra_config": {
      "telemetry/influx":{
          "address":"http://192.168.99.9:8086",
          "ttl":"25s",
          "buffer_size":0,
          "db": "krakend",
          "username": "your-influxdb-user",
          "password": "your-influxdb-password"
      },
      "telemetry/metrics": {
        "collection_time": "30s",
        "listen_address": "127.0.0.1:8090"
      }
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}


- `address` (*string*): The complete url of the influxdb including the port if different from defaults in http/https
- `ttl` (*duration*): Valid time units are: `ns` (nanoseconds), `us` or `Âµs` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes - don't!), `h` (hours - don't!)
- `buffer_size` (*integer*): Use `0` to send events immediately or set the number of points that should be sent together.
- `db` (*string*): Name of the database or bucket, defaults to *krakend*.
- `username` and `password` are optional and used to authenticate against InfluxDB.

See below how to configure InfluxDB, and you are ready to [publish a Grafana dashboard](/docs/v2.0/telemetry/grafana/).

### OpenCensus InfluxDB exporter
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) is a time series database designed to handle high write and query loads.

The Opencensus exporter allows you export data to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com) for monitoring metrics and events. Enabling it only requires you to add the `influxdb` exporter in the [opencensus module](/docs/v2.0/telemetry/opencensus/).

The following configuration snippet sends data to your InfluxDB:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
    "telemetry/opencensus": {
      "exporters": {
        "influxdb": {
            "address": "http://192.168.99.100:8086",
            "db": "krakend",
            "timeout": "1s",
            "username": "your-influxdb-user",
            "password": "your-influxdb-password"
        }
      }
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}
- `address` is the URL (including port) where your InfluxDB is installed.
- `db` is the database name.
- `timeout` is the maximum time you will wait for InfluxDB to respond.
- `username` and `password` are optional and used to authenticate against InfluxDB.

See also the [additional settings](/docs/v2.0/telemetry/opencensus/) of the Opencensus module that can be declared.

## Connecting to Influx
The connection with **InfluxDB v1.x** is straightforward and requires you nothing else than starting an Influx instance with the desired configuration and adding the configuration above.

With the **InfluxDB v2.x** there are a few more steps you need to do the first time you run it.

### Connecting to Influx v1
When using InfluxDB v1.x, you need to specify in the configuration above the same data you used to run InfluxDB. For instance, the following docker compose sets the credentials you need to reflect in the KrakenD configuration.

{{< highlight yaml >}}
version: "3"
services:
  influxdb:
    image: influxdb:1.8
    environment:
      - "INFLUXDB_DB=krakend"
      - "INFLUXDB_USER=krakend-dev"
      - "INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=pas5w0rd"
      - "INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER=admin"
      - "INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword"
    ports:
      - "8086:8086"
  krakend:
    image: devopsfaith/krakend
    volumes:
      - ./krakend:/etc/krakend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
{{< /highlight >}}

In the fields `db`, `username`, and `password` of the component configuration reflect the same values as in `INFLUXDB_DB`, `INFLUXDB_USER`, and `INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD` accordingly.

### Connecting to Influx v2
There are four steps you need to do to connect to an InfluxDB v2:

- Install or run an InfluxDB
- Setup InfluxDB for the first time
- Creating a configuration using a token
- Create a v1 authorization

Let's see them in detail

#### Start an InfluxDB v2
If you use Docker you can start InfluxDB as part of a docker compose file, or independently. For instance:

{{< terminal title="Term" >}}
docker run -it -d --name influxdb -p 8086:8086 influxdb:2.4
{{< /terminal >}}

#### Setup InfluxDB for the first time
Once InfluxDB is started, access with a web browser to `http://localhost:8086` (or the server with InfluxDB), and click the Get Started button to begin the onboarding.

![Setting up Influx](/images/documentation/influx_setup.png)

Create a **username and password** that KrakenD will use to connect and send the metrics. Write your **organization name** and a **bucket name** (database). Write down these values as you will need them later. Now InfluxDB is ready.

#### Create a configuration
Select the **Advanced** button and go to the section **API TOKENS**.

Click on the title of the user's Token and **Copy to Clipboard**, save it somewhere, you will use it in a minute.

![Getting a token](/images/documentation/influx_token.png)

The last step is to create the configuration and auth. For this, connect to the container's shell:

{{< terminal title="Term" >}}
docker exec -it influxdb /bin/bash
{{< /terminal >}}

And now create the configuration as follows:

{{< terminal title="Term" >}}
influx config create --config-name krakend-config \
  --host-url http://localhost:8086 \
  --org KrakenD \
  --token TiukK5nTFsnPhpT360pHRlB5G0Qigbq6yct6IzNDX70cjw-90tsFFAjVPw7D7_ALiARFU8X7ldgIlF03qgbT-A== \
  --active
{{< /terminal >}}

Make sure to replace the values below as follows:

- `config-name` is a random name to identify your configuration
- `org` Your organization name as written during the setup of InfluxDB
- `token` The one you copied in the step above
- `host-url` The address where the influxdb is running (inside Docker is as shown)

The final step is to create the auth for KrakenD.

Return to the InfluxDB UI and select **BUCKETS**. You'll see that there is an ID next to the bucket you created during the Setup. **Copy the bucket ID**.

![Getting a token](/images/documentation/influx_bucket.png)

And now launch the last command in the shell:

{{< terminal title="Term" >}}
influx v1 auth create \
  --read-bucket b492e6f8f3b13aaa
  --write-bucket b492e6f8f3b13aaa
  --username user
{{< /terminal >}}

Replace the ID of the buckets above with the ID you just copied. The shell will ask for your password.

Now your configuration should work and start sending data to InfluxDB:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
    "version": 3,
    "extra_config": {
        "telemetry/metrics": {
            "collection_time": "60s",
            "listen_address": ":8090"
        },
        "telemetry/influx": {
            "address": "http://localhost:8086",
            "ttl": "25s",
            "buffer_size": 100,
            "db": "krakend_db",
            "username": "user",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Make sure to type in `db` the bucket name you created on InfluxDB and the `username` and `password` as well.
