[AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) is a service offered by Amazon that provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components.

The Opencensus exporter allows you export data to AWS X-Ray. Enabling it only requires you to add the `xray` exporter in the [opencensus module](/docs/v2.5/telemetry/opencensus/).

The following configuration snippet sends data to your X-Ray:

```json
{
  "extra_config": {
    "telemetry/opencensus": {
      "sample_rate": 100,
      "reporting_period": 0,
      "exporters": {
        "xray": {
          "version": "latest",
          "region": "eu-west-1",
          "use_env": false,
          "access_key_id": "myaccesskey",
          "secret_access_key": "mysecretkey"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
As with all [OpenCensus exporters](/docs/v2.5/telemetry/opencensus/), you can add optional settings in the `telemetry/opencensus` level:

{{< schema version="v2.5" data="telemetry/opencensus.json" filter="sample_rate,reporting_period,enabled_layers">}}

Then, the `exporters` key must contain an `xray` entry with the following properties:

{{< schema version="v2.5" data="telemetry/opencensus.json" property="exporters" filter="xray" >}}

See also the [additional settings](/docs/v2.5/telemetry/opencensus/) of the Opencensus module that can be declared.
