The `ocagent` exporter sends OpenCensus Stats and Traces to the OpenCensus Agent, instead of pushing data to backends’ exporters.

For instance, you can enable ocagent to upload data to the OpenCensus Agent, and from there, the agent is simply scraped by a Prometheus.

You can integrate the OpenCensus Agent with Azure Monitor, Jaeger, or Prometheus to name a few examples.

Enabling it only requires you to add the `ocagent` exporter in the [opencensus module](/docs/telemetry/opencensus/).

The following configuration snippet sends the data:

```json
{
  "extra_config": {
    "telemetry/opencensus": {
      "sample_rate": 100,
      "reporting_period": 0,
      "exporters": {
       "ocagent": {
          "address": "collector",
          "service_name": "krakend",
          "reconnection": "2s",
           "insecure": false,
          "enable_compression": true,
          "headers": {
            "header1": "value1"
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```


As with all [OpenCensus exporters](/docs/telemetry/opencensus/), you can add optional settings in the `telemetry/opencensus` level:

{{< schema data="telemetry/opencensus.json" filter="sample_rate,reporting_period,enabled_layers">}}

Then, the `exporters` key must contain an `ocagent` entry with the following properties:

{{< schema data="telemetry/opencensus.json" property="exporters" filter="ocagent" >}}
